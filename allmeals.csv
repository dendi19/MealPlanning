Steak Bruschetta ,Dinner,"Roast:<br>
1.5 lb beef tenderloin roast<br>
olive oil<br>
salt & pepper<br><br>
Bruschetta:<br>
1 loaf baguette, sourdough, asiago loaf, or bread of choice, sliced<br>
6 shallots, sliced not minced<br>
½ cup butter + 4 tbsp for cooking shallots<br><br>
Seasonal Thyme Mayo:<br>
1 cup mayonnaise (Hellmann's)<br>
¼ cup fig jam<br>
1 tsp kosher salt<br>
1 tsp pepper<br>
1 tsp fresh thyme","Shallots:
Heat 3 tbsp of butter (or use oil) on medium heat then add the shallots, stir until coated, add a pinch of salt (speeds up caramelizing process) and brown them until caramelized. Caramelizing onions brings out their amazing natural flavor. Make sure the pan doesn't get too hot or the butter will burn. Continue this process of cooking and deglazing until the onions have reached the color, flavor, and texture you desire.
Roast:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Rub roast with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on all sides.
Melt ½ cup butter on medium/high heat in a skillet. Add roast once the pan is hot (it should sizzle upon adding or the pan is not hot enough and you will get tougher meat from the steaming).
Flip the roast to brown each side, including the ends. You want a nice brown ""crust"" on each side. Use tongs for this.
Add more butter as you go, if needed, as to not let the pan get dry.
Bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.
Take out of the oven and tent it with foil to keep warm. Let is rest on counter for 10 minutes.
Slice thin.
Mayo:
Mix all ingredients in a bowl until combined.
Bread:
Saute 2 tbsp butter in skillet. Add bread slices, in one layer. Pan fry on both sides until a nice golden brown color.
Spread thyme mayo on on bread slice. Place slices of beef (1 or 2 depending on size of bread slices) on top. Top with a spoonful of the caramelized shallots and a piece of fresh thyme (optional).",https://wishesndishes.com/holiday-steak-bruschetta-le-creuset-giveaway/,,,

Grilled Lemon Chicken Flatbread,Lunch,"Grilled Lemon Chicken Flatbread Wraps Ingredients:<br>
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 2 large breasts), cubed into bite-size pieces<br>
Olive oil<br>
2 cloves garlic, pressed through garlic press<br>
Zest of 1 lemon (about 1 tablespoon)<br>
1 tablespoon lemon juice<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
Pinch or two black pepper<br>
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano<br>
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br>
1/4 teaspoon coriander<br>
1/4 teaspoon paprika<br>
4 middle eastern-style flatbreads (you can use pita bread, as well)<br>
Arugula greens<br>
Sliced tomatoes<br><br>
Spicy Garlic Sauce Ingredients:<br>

1/2 cup mayonnaise<br>
1/2 cup sour cream or full-fat, plain Greek yogurt<br>
3 cloves garlic, pressed through garlic press<br>
1 tablespoon tahini<br>
2 to 3 teaspoons sriracha (I used a lot more since I like mine spicy, so use your own judgement!)<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
Pinch black pepper<br>
Pinch cayenne pepper (again, you can use more, if you like it spicier)<br>
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice","Place the cubed chicken into a medium-size bowl, and drizzle in about 2 tablespoons of olive oil; add in the garlic, plus the remainder of the ingredients up to and including the paprika, and using your hands, toss all of the seasonings/spices very well to coat the chicken.
Using 4 bamboo skewers (you can soak these in water first to prevent burning), skewer the chicken so that there is equal portions of meat on each skewer, and allow the chicken to marinate for about 20 minutes, or even overnight, if making ahead.
While the chicken marinates, prep the garlic sauce by adding all the ingredients to a medium-size bowl, and whisking together until completely smooth and creamy; set aside, or keep in the fridge, covered. (I like to put mine in a plastic squeeze bottle, and keep any leftovers in the fridge to use for other sandwiches, or as a tasty condiment.)
When ready to grill, place a grill pan over medium-high heat (you can certainly use your outdoor grill, as well), and drizzle in a little oil; once the oil gets hot, place the chicken skewers into the pan, and cook them for about 6-8 minutes, turning them occasionally so that they get a bit charred on all sides, or until cooked through; allow them to rest, lightly covered with foil, for about 5-10 minutes; then, remove the chicken cubes from the skewers and set aside.
To assemble, add a little drizzle of the spicy garlic sauce onto the flatbread, followed by the greens; then, add a couple of slices of tomato, and about one skewer-worth of the lemon chicken; drizzle over a generous amount of the spicy garlic sauce, and fold the sides towards the middle to form a “wrap” (you can even use some parchment paper or foil to hold it all together, if you’d like).",https://thecozyapron.com/grilled-lemon-chicken-flatbread-wraps/,,,
